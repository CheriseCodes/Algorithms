# Algorithms
Implementations of foundational algorithms and data structures in Computer Science

# Usage

```bash
make
./main
```
## Learning goals

1. Review foundational algorithms and data structures
2. Develop skills to build efficient, maintainable, and secure C++ code

## CLRS

The first collection of algorithms and data structures I plan to implement are from the infamous "Introduction to Algorithms" (3rd edition) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein (also known as CLRS).

Here's a **TODO** list tracking how much I've implemented so far:

#### Sorting

- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Heapsort
- [x] Quicksort
- [x] Randomized Quick Sort
- [x] Counting sort
- [x] Radix sort
- [x] Bucket sort

#### Order Statistics
- [X] Maximum
- [X] Minimum
- [X] Randomized Select

#### Data Structures (will use the STL for data structures that use elementary data structures)
- [X] Stack
- [X] Queue
- [X] Linked List
- [ ] Pointer
- [ ] Direct Access Table
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Reb-Black Tree
- [ ] Order-Stastic Tree
- [ ] Interval Tree

#### Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Rod cutting
- [ ] Matrix Multiplication (chained)
- [ ] Longest common subsequence
- [ ] Optimal Binary Search Tree

#### Greedy Algorithms
... to be continued...
